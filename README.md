# Blind Auction (Python)

## Description
This project is a simple Python program that simulates a **blind auction game** in the terminal.  
Multiple users can enter their name and bid amount without knowing others' bids.  
At the end, the program calculates the highest bid and announces the winner.  

Itâ€™s a beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates the use of:
- Functions
- Dictionaries
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- ASCII art for fun visuals
